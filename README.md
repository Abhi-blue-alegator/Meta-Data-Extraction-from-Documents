# Meta-Data-Extraction-from-Documents
This project focuses on developing an AI/ML system for extracting metadata from documents regardless of their template format. Users can upload scanned images or .docx files, and the system extracts key fields such as Agreement Value, Agreement Start Date, Agreement End Date, Renewal Notice (Days), Party One, and Party Two. The system avoids rule-based approaches, ensuring flexibility across various document types.
